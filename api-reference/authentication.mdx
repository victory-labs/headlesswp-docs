## Authenticating with an API key

To authenticate, include an `Authorization` header in your request with the `X-WP-API-Key` token format, where `your-api-key-here` is the API key provided for your account.

```
Authorization: X-WP-API-Key your-api-key-here
```

Make sure to replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual API key.
