## Base URL

The WordPress API adheres to REST principles and enforces HTTPS for all requests to ensure data security and integrity. HTTP requests are not supported.

All requests are made to the following base URL:

```
http://yoursite.com/wp-json/wp/v2
```

## Response Codes

The API uses standard HTTP codes to indicate request outcomes:

| Status | Description                                                   |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200    | Successful request.                                           |
| 400    | Parameter validation errorâ€”check that parameters are correct. |
| 401    | Missing or expired API key.                                   |
| 403    | Invalid or unauthorized API key.                              |
| 404    | Resource not found.                                           |
| 429    | Rate limit exceeded.                                          |
| 5xx    | Server error on your WordPress site.                          |
