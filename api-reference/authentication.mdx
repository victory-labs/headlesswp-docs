## Authenticating with an API key

To authenticate, include an `Authorization` header in your request with the `X-WP-API-Key` token format, where `your-api-key-here` is the API key provided for your account.

```
Authorization: X-WP-API-Key your-api-key-here
```

Make sure to replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual API key.

## Creating and refreshing session

We use JWT auth to retrieve a token for the session. First, you must login using [/auth/login]('/api-reference/auth/login) and then refresh your session with [/auth/refresh]('/api-reference/auth/refresh).
